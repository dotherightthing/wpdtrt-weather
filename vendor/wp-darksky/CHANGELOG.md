# Changelog

#### 1.1.1 - 07/17/2017 - Fix Issue Causing Query To Be Ignored
Per #10: Expanded the code for checking the query array and query string separately. The previous condensed version was causing the HTTP query parameters to be omitted in the final API Request URL.

#### 1.1.0 - 01/04/2017 - Change to Dark Sky API
Updated for Dark Sky API.

#### 1.0.0
Initial release, plus bugs and follow up. Honestly, I didn't track anything until 1.1.0. Sorry.
